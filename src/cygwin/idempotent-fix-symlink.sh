# Fix up symlinks like those pointing to Opam roots in C:\Opam, and also C:\Windows if
# your $env:SYSTEMROOT is non-standard.
#
# Not only do we not maintain a C:\Opam directory, we want relative symlinks since we'll be cloning those Opam roots.
#
# Example 1:
#         Actual: $PWD/build/_tools/common/ocaml-opam/msvc-amd64/opam/.opam/plugins/bin/opam-depext.exe -> /cygdrive/c/opam/.opam/4.12/bin/opam-depext.exe
#   1. C:\ Move : $PWD     # (1)/(2) make an absolute path to (Actual). This value does not need to be $PWD but it does need to be absolute.
#   2. C:\ Move :      build/_tools/common/ocaml-opam/msvc-amd64/     # Originally there was a file C:/opam/.opam/plugins/bin/opam-depext.exe but we moved C:\
#   3. C:\ Clone: /cygdrive/c/                        # We cloned opam/.opam/4.12/bin/opam-depext.exe which is everything on the right hand side except /c/
#        Desired: $PWD/build/_tools/common/ocaml-opam/msvc-amd64/opam/.opam/plugins/bin/opam-depext.exe -> ../../../4.12/bin/opam-depext.exe
#
# Terminology in analogy with Example 1:
#         Actual: REFEREE -> ABSOLUTE_REFERENT
#   1. Move Base: BASE_MOVEDIR
#   2.  Move Rel: RELATIVE_MOVEDIR
#   3.     Clone: ABSOLUTE_CLONEDIR
#        Desired: REFEREE -> RELATIVE_REFERENT
#
# Example 2: if your $env:SYSTEMROOT was Z:\Windows
#         Actual: $PWD/build/_tools/common/ocaml-opam/msvc-amd64/cygwin64/etc/hosts -> /cygdrive/c/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts
#        Desired: $PWD/build/_tools/common/ocaml-opam/msvc-amd64/cygwin64/etc/hosts -> /cygdrive/z/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts
#
# Usage: <this_script> REFEREE BASE_MOVEDIR RELATIVE_MOVEDIR ABSOLUTE_CLONEDIR
# Outcome:
#  * No REFEREE will change if ABSOLUTE_REFERENT does not start with ABSOLUTE_CLONEDIR (this is idempotency)
#  * Otherwise:
#    a) if ABSOLUTE_REFERENT points to C:\Windows and is dangling (does not point to real file), this script
#       will change REFERREE as in Example 2
#    b) else this script will change REFEREE to RELATIVE_REFERENT as in Example 1
