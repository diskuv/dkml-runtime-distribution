##      global-compile
#       note: this could be global-install if we had a shim.
#             bin/utop and bin/utop-full are bytecode ocamlrun
#             executables, so the shim just needs to proxy to
#             bin/ocamlrun.

##      global-compile
#       note: The global-compile is so that the (bytecode, non-relocatable) utop can
#              load in base with: #require "base";;
