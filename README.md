# dkml-runtime-distribution 0.4.0-prerel14

Scripts used by the Diskuv OCaml distribution during the installation of:
* a local project (ie. a Opam switch created with `opam dkml init`)
* a user profile (ex. OCaml binaries installed within the user's home directory)
* a machine (ex. system or Administrator assembly/C compilers)

Typically this code is downloaded as a .tar.gz source release, git cloned
or vendored (git submodule).
